\begin{abstract}

We present a parallel approach to classification using neural networks as the hypothesis class.
Neural networks can have millions of parameters and learning the optimum value of all parameters from huge datasets can be very time consuming task, if implemented on a single processor.
In this work, we have implemented parallel backpropagation to train Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for classification tasks. Specifically, we implement a serial backpropagation algorithm and its parallel counterpart with Pthread library in C++.
We also compare the two implementations with cuda implementation of backpropagation on a GPU and study the parallelization speedup obtained for various network architectures and increasing problem sizes.
We perform our tests on two benchmark datasets: MNIST and KDD Cup 1999, and finally compare all our implementations with the same implementations done with a state-of-the-art deep learning library: Theano.

%\subsection{Algorithms}
%
%If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic'' 
%environments to format pseudocode. These require 
%the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and 
%algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package. 
%Algorithm~\ref{alg:example} shows an example. 
%
%\begin{algorithm}[tb]
%   \caption{Bubble Sort}
%   \label{alg:example}
%\begin{algorithmic}
%   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
%   \REPEAT
%   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
%   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
%   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$} 
%   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
%   \STATE $noChange = false$
%   \ENDIF
%   \ENDFOR
%   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
%\end{algorithmic}
%\end{algorithm}
% 
%\subsection{Tables} 
% 
%You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like 
%figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively. 
%However, place the title {\it above\/} the table with at least 
%0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in 
%Table~\ref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point 
%type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
%should be flush left.
%
%% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing 
%% above and below tabular lines.

%
%Tables contain textual material that can be typeset, as contrasted 
%with figures, which contain graphical material that must be drawn. 
%Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
%row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
%wide tables across both columns, but place two-column tables at the
%top or bottom of the page.

%\subsection{Citations and References} 
%
%Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
%or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic 
%facility, use {\tt natbib.sty} and {\tt icml2015.bst} 
%included in the style-file package to obtain this format.
%
%Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
%year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
%the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
%pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
%reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
%comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
%semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
%construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
%listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.
%
%Authors should cite their own work in the third person
%in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
%Please refer to Section~\ref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
%cite your own papers.
%
%Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and 
%use a hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush
%against the left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. 
%The references at the end of this document give examples for journal
%articles \cite{Samuel59}, conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books \cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, 
%technical reports \cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}. 
%
%Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
%single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
%references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
%earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
%information (e.g., page numbers).
%
%\subsection{Software and Data}
%
%We strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
%camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate.  This can be
%done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy.  However, do not
%include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
%submission for review.  Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
%the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the CMT reviewing
%system.  Note that reviewers are not required to look a this material
%when writing their review.
%
%
%% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version. 
%\section*{Acknowledgments} 
% 
%\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
%the paper submitted for blind review.
%
%If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
%probably should) include acknowledgements. In this case, please
%place such acknowledgements in an unnumbered section at the
%end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
%who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas, 
%and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial 
%support.
