\section{Future Work}
\label{Future}

It would be an interesting idea to combine the two parallelization techniques that we have explored in this paper as future work.
Specifically, it might be possible to speed up the training even more by splitting training examples in parallel, and then further hierarchically parallelizing matrix computations for each individual example.
