\section{Results and Analysis}
\label{Results}

Provide experiment results: serial \\
Compare serial vs pthreads vs cuda vs theano. \\
Provide graphs for speedup with increasing problem size \\
Analyze speedup with number of threads/cores used \\
Analyze the level of parallelization obtained \\
Analyze performance bottlenecks \\
Do overall analysis and compare obtained results with your expectations
